<p>Many of the lowRISC team (Robert Mullins, Wei Song, and Alex Bradbury) have
been in Boston this week for the fourth RISC-V workshop. By any measure, this
has been a massive success with over 250 attendees representing 63 companies
and 42 Universities. Wei presented our most recent work on integrating trace
debug, which you&rsquo;ll soon be able to read much more about here (it&rsquo;s worth
signing up to our <a href="http://www.lowrisc.org/about/">announcement list</a> if you want to
be informed of each of our releases).</p>

<h2 id="risc-v-foundation-update-rick-o-connor:d6abfe74eb81763dfd1b1ef050360823">RISC-V Foundation update: Rick O&rsquo;Connor</h2>

<ul>
<li>Next RISC-V Workshop will be Nov 29th-30th at Google&rsquo;s Mountain View, CA</li>
<li>The RISC-V ISA and related standards shall remain open and license-free to
all parties, and the member agreement with RISC-V Foundation will include a
license for the trademark</li>
<li>Trademark license for commercial use is part of being a silver, gold, or
platinum member</li>
<li>Founding member status has now finished.</li>
<li>You don&rsquo;t have to be a member to participate in specifications - each task
group must include at least one round of public consultation.</li>
<li>Question: any plans for workshops outside of the USA? Answer: yes, we would
like to do that</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="risc-v-interrupts-krste-asanović:d6abfe74eb81763dfd1b1ef050360823">RISC-V interrupts: Krste Asanović</h2>

<ul>
<li>Want a standard that is useful in high performance Unix-like systems (fast
cores, smart devices), low/mid embedded systems (slow cores, dumb devices),
and high-performance realtime systems (can&rsquo;t waste time on interrupt overhead)</li>
<li>Design goals: simplicity, support all kinds of platforms, allow tradeoffs
between performance and implementation cost, be flexible to support
specialised needs</li>
<li>Interrupts are either local or global.

<ul>
<li>Local interrupts are directly connected to one hardware thread (hart) with
no arbitration. On RISC-V, there is currently only two of these: software
and timer.</li>
<li>For global (external) interrupts, they are routed via the memory-mapped
Platform-Level Interrupt Controller (PLIC)</li>
</ul></li>
<li>A new CSR, the Machine Interrupt Pending (mip) register is added. It has
separate interrupts for each supported privilege level.</li>
<li>User-level interrupt handling is an optional feature. This may be used in
secure embedded systems.</li>
<li>Software interrupts

<ul>
<li>MSIP (machine software interrupt) can only be written in machine mode via
a memory-mapped control register. This is used for inter-hart interrupts.
Also have HSIP, SSIP, USIP. A hart can only write its own HSIP, SSIP, USIP.</li>
<li>The App/OS/Hypervisor can only perform inter-hart interrupts via
ABI/SBI/HBI calls</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Timer interrupts: MTIP is a single 64-bit real-time hardware timer and
comparator in M-mode. You want this because due to frequency scaling etc, just
going by cycle count is not useful. HTIP, STIP, UTIP are set up by M-mode
software.</li>
<li>When running at a given privilege level, all interrupts for lower levels are
disabled.</li>
<li>All interrupts trap to M-mode by default, and M-mode software can redirect
to the other privilege level as necessary. mideleg can be used to
automatically delegate interrupts to the next privilege level.</li>
<li>Conceptually, when interrupts come in to the PLIC they are handled by the
gateway. This abstracts away differences between different interrupt sources.
e.g. level-triggered, edge-triggered etc. A new request isn&rsquo;t forwarded to the
PLIC core unless the previous request&rsquo;s handler has signaled completion.</li>
<li>Each interrupt has an ID and priority. These priorities can be fixed or
variable. The PLIC stores per-target information</li>
<li>An interrupted hart will try to claim an interrupt from the PLIC with a read
of the memory-mapped register. It could have been claimed by someone else, and
the PLIC core is responsible for ensuring the interrupts it received by only
one hart.</li>
<li>If you want to add more levels of nested interrupt handling, add more harts
to your system.</li>
<li>The position of the PLIC in the memory map isn&rsquo;t defined by the
specification because many people will have existing memory maps.</li>
<li>Question: would you have multiple PLICs on a multi-core system? Answer:
conceptually, there is only one PLIC though it could be implemented in a
distributed fashion.</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="formal-specification-of-risc-v-uniprocessor-consistency-arvind:d6abfe74eb81763dfd1b1ef050360823">Formal specification of RISC-V uniprocessor consistency: Arvind</h2>

<ul>
<li>Joint project with Adam Chlipala. The slogan is &ldquo;chips with proofs&rdquo;. These
are multicore chips that satisfy the RISC-V ISA specifications and are capable
of booting Linux.</li>
<li>Both the design and the proofs must be modular and amenable to modular
refinement.</li>
<li>Mostly concerned about microarchitecture and memory system correctness.</li>
<li>Specs and designs are expressed in Bluespec.</li>
<li>See also <a href="http://plv.csail.mit.edu/kami/">Kami</a>, a framework for Coq for
performing proofs about Bluespec programs.</li>
<li>A specification should avoid using concepts such as partially executed
instructions or &ldquo;a store was been performed with respect to&hellip;&rdquo;.
Non-determinism is necessary, but unspecified behaviour should be avoided.</li>
<li>Semantics are defined in terms of &lsquo;I2E&rsquo;, the Instantaneous Instruction
Execution framework. Simply, an instruction executes instantaneously ensuring
the processor state is always up to date. Data moves between processors and
memory asynchronously according to some background rules. Memory
model-specific buffers are placed between the processor state and memory.</li>
<li>WMM is a possible memory model for RISC-V, where both loads and stores can
be re-ordered. Conceptually, invalidation buffers are added alongside the
store buffer in order to make stale values visible. Whenever a stale value is
removed from the invalidation buffer, any values that are older (more stale)
must also be removed.</li>
<li>Memory issues arise even within a uniprocessor, due to self-modifying code
and page table access and the TLB. The fundamental issue is with multiple
paths to the same memory.</li>
<li>Arvind is concerned that when defining formal semantics, a very weak memory
model may become very (too?) complex.</li>

<ul>
<li>Want to build a large ecosystem around FD-SOI in Europe, including IP and
chipset libraries.</li>
<li>PULSAR is a RISC-V big.LITTLE-style heterogeneous multicore. Two small cores
(rocket without FPU, 8KB L1 caches) and two big cores (3-way super-scalar BOOM
and 32KB L1 caches). It features an AMBA interconnect generated by Synopsys
CoreAssembler and has multiple body-bias zones.</li>
<li>Currently looking to use it in the context of a pedestrian navigation
system.</li>
<li>128-bit link to DDR5 controller, plus 4+4GTX SERDES to a separate FPGA.</li>
<li>Also features the AntX processor, which is a very small 32-bit RISC Harvard
design from CEA Tech.</li>
<li>Used hardware emulation with ZeBu (Synopsys)</li>
<li>Also used SESAM for virtual prototyping (based on SystemC/TLM 2.0). This is
up to 90% accurate compared to RTL. Have also developed SCale, a new parallel
SystemC kernel.</li>
<li>Synthesis results show 2.64mm2, 0.6W, 700MHz.</li>
<li>Question: will the work be open-sourced? Answer: Don&rsquo;t know yet.</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="nvidia-risc-v-evaluation-story-joe-xie:d6abfe74eb81763dfd1b1ef050360823">NVidia RISC-V evaluation story: Joe Xie</h2>

<ul>
<li>Want to reproduce the existing NVIDIA falcon CPU with a new ISA</li>
<li>Falcon - FAst Logic CONtroller. Introduced over 10 years ago and used in
more than 15 different hardware engines today. Low area, secure, flexible. 6
stage pipeline, variable length instructions (proprietary NVIDIA ISA).</li>
<li>The next generation for Falcon is needed for higher performance and rich OS
support. Old Falcon is 0.67 DMIPS/MHz, 1.4 Coremark/Mhz</li>
<li>Options were to buy access to a current architecture (MIPS, ARM, others) or
build (move to RISC-V or improve Falcon). Obviously, they elected to move to
RISC-V. The fact the ISA is extensible is a key advantage. Want an area of
less than 0.1mm2 at 16FF.</li>
<li>NV-RISCV is 5 stage in-order issue, out-of-order execution. It has a
in-order write buffer. No FPU. Makes use of an MPU with base and bound
protection. It will initially be added to the Falcon as a 2nd core to provide
easy backwards compatibility.</li>
<li>Area for 16FF: Falcon 0.03mm2 vs Rocket 0.055mm2 vs NV-RISC-V 0.05-0.06mm2.</li>
<li>Did a lot of cache optimisations to tolerate large latency. Store buffer,
write merging, line-fill buffer, victim buffer, stream buffer.</li>
<li>Areas of interest include toolchain (for automotive, debug, performance
tuning, flexibility, ilp32/ilp64). Also security (crypto instructions and
extensions), and adding cache manipulation instructions.</li>
<li>Question: why design your own core rather than use an existing one? Answer:
after evaluating the options, it made the most sense. The motivation to go to
RISC-V was technical as well as influenced by cost.</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="isa-shootout-a-comparison-of-risc-v-arm-and-x86-chris-celio:d6abfe74eb81763dfd1b1ef050360823">ISA Shootout – a Comparison of RISC-V, ARM, and x86: Chris Celio</h2>

<ul>
<li>Recently released a new tech report <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/1607.02318">The renewed case for the Reduced
Instruction Set Computer</a>.</li>
<li>The conventional wisdom is that CISC ISAs are more expressive and dense than
RISC ISAs, while RISC ISAs map well to high-performance pipelines. Of course,
a number of designs have CISC instructions translating to RISC-like micro-ops.</li>
<li>Chris&rsquo; contention is that a well designed RISC ISA can be very competitive
with CISC ISAs. It can be denser and higher performance.</li>
<li><code>ldmiaeq sp!, {r4-r7, PC}</code> is an ARMv7 instruction (load
multiple-increment-address) which will write to 7 registers and perform 6
loads. This is a common idiom for stack pop and return from a function call.</li>
<li>Goal is to get a baseline to measure the current code generation quality of
the RISC-V gcc port. Given a fixed ISA, what can the compiler do to improve
performance? What can the programmer do? What can the micro-architect do? A
specific non-goal is to lobby for more instructions (CISC or otherwise).</li>
<li>Dynamic instruction count can be very misleading due to the possibility it
decodes to many micro-ops. Conversely, macro-op fusion may take multiple
instructions and fuse them on the fly.</li>
<li>Looking at 6 ISAs, using 12 benchmarks from SpecINT 2006.</li>
<li>Average 16% more instructions for RISC-V vs x86-64, though roughly even in
terms of micro-ops. With the compressed instruction set extension, RISC-V wins
in terms of instruction bytes fetched on many of the benchmarks. Overall, 28%
fewer instruction bytes than ARMv7 and 8% fewer than x86-64.</li>
<li>Adding array indices is the most common idiom, so why not add an indexed
load instruction to match x86? But with the compressed ISA, a pair of
compressed instructions can be treated as an indexed load by the decoder.</li>
<li>Proposed macro-op fusion pairs: load effective address, indexed load, clear
upper word. These idioms provide 5.4% fewer &ldquo;effective&rdquo; instructions for RV64.</li>
<li>Fusion isn&rsquo;t just for superscalar out-of-order cores. Chris believes it
should be used by all RISC-V cores. For instance, Rocket (single issue) can be
modified to perform this.</li>
<li>Better code generation is possible if the compiler knows fusion is
available.</li>
<li>RISC can be denser, faster, and stay simple!</li>
<li>Question: will compressed become standard? Answer: it may become part of the
de-facto standard or even Linux ABI standard. Still more to be done to fully
understand the complexity for processor implementations.</li>
<li>Question: how does macro-op fusion interact with things like faults and
precise exceptions? Answer: it does add extra complexity. One solution is if
you get a fault, then re-fetch and execute without fusion.</li>

<ul>
<li>For analytics, need a deep net with many nodes. This demands balanced
low-latency computing I/O, memory, and storage processing.</li>
<li>Wireless network evolution is driven by real-time data with better QoS. Very
rapid growth rate in bandwidth and reduction in round-trip time latency for
LTE, LTE-A, 5G, &hellip;</li>
<li>Built a deep learning micro-cluster. Uses RapidIO, NVidia GPUs. No RISC-V
though. They&rsquo;ve then looked at how this might look with RISC-V cores instead.</li>
<li>Want to support AXI rand RapidIO.</li>
<li>Produced a hardware simulation model with TileLink packet generators
producing data that is transferred over a RapidIO transport.</li>
<li>A RISC-V CPU generator model with port for RapidIO available (where?)</li>

<ul>
<li>There are two emerging resistive non-volatile memories. ReRAM and PCM. Read
latency is orders of magnitude lower than NAND, somewhere between that of DRAM
and NAND.</li>
<li>Should non-volatile memories be treated like memory, or like storage?</li>
<li>For now, it seems to make sense to have the digital logic for the NVM
controller off-chip (including coherence state).</li>
<li>Wear levelling, data protection at rest further motivate the controller
being placed along with non-volatile media.</li>
<li>One potential approach is a coherent storage controller in reconfigurable
logic.</li>
<li>RISC-V shopping list: Hardware coherence, fast+wide ports for peripherals to
join the coherence domain, relinquish the non-volatile memory controller for
now, and get used to high variability in main memory response time.</li>

<h2 id="risc-v-as-a-basis-for-asip-design-drake-smith:d6abfe74eb81763dfd1b1ef050360823">RISC-V as a basis for ASIP design: Drake Smith</h2>

<ul>
<li>&ldquo;Every design is different, so why is every embedded processor the same?&rdquo;</li>
<li>Using RISC-V as a basis for ASIP can avoid many concerns. SecureRF produces
quantum-resistant security for low resource devices using group theoretic
cryptography.</li>
<li>Using the Microsemi Smartfusion2+ board as the test platform.</li>
<li>With a software-only port, their WalnutDSA was 63x faster thn Micro-ECC.</li>
<li>Adding a custom instruction to accelerate it only added 2% area on the FPGA
and gave another 3x increase in speed.</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="an-updated-on-building-the-risc-v-software-ecosystem-arun-thomas:d6abfe74eb81763dfd1b1ef050360823">An updated on building the RISC-V software ecosystem: Arun Thomas</h2>

<ul>
<li>2016 wishlist: Upstream GNU toolchain, Clang//LLVM and QEMU. Also Linux
kernel, Yocto, Gentoo, and BSD. Plus Debian/RISC-V port.</li>
<li>Now people are getting ready to send patches for review for toolchains and
QEMU.</li>
<li>FreeBSD 11 will officially support RISC-V. For the Debian/RISC-V port, see
Manuel&rsquo;s talk tomorrow.</li>
<li>Arun argues the Foundation should fund developers to build core software
infrastructure. Additionally, we should also decide on a process for proposing
ISA enhancements.</li>
<li>What might funded developers do? Upstreaming and maintainership, porting
software, performance optimisation/analysis, enhancing test suites and
methodologies, continuous integration and release management.</li>
<li>How should proposals be be handled? Various groups have approaches for this
already. e.g. Rust, Python, IEEE, IETF. Arun has put together a <a href="https://github.com/arunthomas/riscv-rfcs">straw-man
proposal on specification
development</a>.</li>
<li>Arun would like to see the next iteration for the privileged spec to go
through a comment period.</li>

<h2 id="orca-lve-embedded-risc-v-with-lightweight-vector-extensions-guy-lemieux:d6abfe74eb81763dfd1b1ef050360823">ORCA-LVE, embedded RISC-V with lightweight vector extensions: Guy Lemieux</h2>

<ul>
<li>Using 900LUTs for a speedup of 12x. Proposed and added a standardised vector
engine to their processor.</li>
<li>Smallest version of the ORCA implementation can fit in 2k LUTS on the
Lattice iCE40 and runs at about 20MHz.</li>
<li>Their approach for lightweight vector extensions is to add a dedicated
vector data scratchpad and to re-use the RISC-V ALU.</li>
<li>Vector operands are just RISC-V scalar registers containing pointers into
the vector scratchpad.</li>
<li>To encode vector operations, they use two 32-bit instruction bundles.</li>
<li>To allocate vector data, just use an alternative malloc function. Intrinsics
are available to manipulate vectors.</li>
<li>In the future, want to add 2D and 3D operations as well as subword SIMD.</li>
<li>Why not using the proposed RISC-V vector extensions? Because the detailed
proposal isn&rsquo;t yet released, and LVE intends to be more lightweight and lower
overhead.</li>
<li>Question: can these instructions raise exceptions? Answer: that hasn&rsquo;t been
properly defined yet.</li>

peripherals), and &ldquo;Freedom Everywhere&rdquo; (targeted at embedded and IoT).</li>
<li>The Freedom Unleashed demo will be shown today, running on an FPGA connected

utility library, and reference processor implementations. Currently
multi-cycle and in-order pipelined. Soon, out-of-order execution.</li>
<li>Have infrastructure for tandem verification.</li>
<li>How is modular design possible? RTL modules are not modularly refinable
under composition, i.e. implementation details of one module may put
additional constraints on another. But BSV language features do support
composability.</li>
<li>The processor design flow involves taking the Riscy blocks, forming the
initial connections, performing modular refinement, and then scheduling
optimisation to reduce overheads due to BSV scheduling logic.</li>
<li>Connectal implements the connections from FPGA to a host computer through
PCIe. This also works on Zynq FPGAs with an AXI transport.</li>
<li>Tandem verification: run the same program on two RISC-V implementations at
once. Generated verification packets at commit stage, use non-deterministic
information from the implementation under test for synchronisation, and then
compare the results.</li>
<li>Check out the code <a href="https://github.com/csail-csg/riscy">on Github</a>.</li>
<li>Planned work involves formal specifications, proofs for modules, and proof
for processors.</li>

<ul>
<li>Lattice&rsquo;s vision for an FPGA IoT platform is that it has high ease of use
(use C/C++ as design entry), and flexibility for a range of sensors,
actuators, communication devices.</li>
<li>A hybrid computing solution: the RISC-V processor with FPGA hardware. RISC-V
processor plus LegUp-generated hardware acclerators to handle the processing
part of the IoT platform.</li>
<li>The Lattice RISC-V processor has a 4 stage pipeline, and can be configured
for RV32I, RV32IM, and RV32IC. It compares favourably to the LM32, e.g. RV32IC
takes 1.6K LUTs vs 2K LUTs for the LM32 while also achieving higher DMIPS and
code density.</li>
<li>LegUp is a high level synthesis tool.</li>
<li>For a sum of squares of speech samples example, the LegUp synthesized
accelerator gives a 5.4x speedup vs the RISC-V software implementation.</li>
<li>LegUp has plans to support LegUp-synthesized custom instruction
implementations</li>

<li>Includes support for profiling and core execution trace.</li>
<li>Coremark/Mhz is competitive with the ARM Cortex M4.</li>
<li>Hardware loop instructions benefit control-intensive applications</li>
<li>Add DSP extensions to improve energy efficiency for signal processing

<ul>
<li>How do we handle the &lsquo;edge&rsquo; of a metadata tagged system? e.g. I/O to the
untagged world, legacy devices, DMA.</li>
<li>PUMP is a metadata processing engine that checks tags upon every instruction
and memory access.</li>
<li>For slave devices, tags can be associated with memory mapped devices. These
are used to write rules to control access. This allows giving configuration
control to particular drivers, without giving the driver control to all
devices or other privileges.</li>
<li>DMA I/O policies might target: containment (who&rsquo;s allowed to read/write a
buffer), integrity (mark incoming data as untrusted), secrecy, and
data presence/synchronisation.</li>
<li>Add new supported opcodes as input to the PUMP representing DMA load and DMA
store. Modify PC tag and Instr tag to represent the state of the DMA and the
DMA source.</li>
<li>If a DMA is deemed to be misbehaving, it can be totally disabled by the PUMP
or the particular operation could be discarded.</li>
<li>In this design, there is both an IO pump and a processor PUMP. The IO pump
is pipelined so it will not reduce system throughput.</li>
<li>The IO pump generates an interrupt on a rule miss. The miss handler uses the
same rule function as for the processor PUMP.</li>

<li>System hyper pipelining is based on C-slow retiming. It replaces original

<li>Debian contains a mix of officially supported ports, unofficial releases (on

<li>Why a Debian port for RISC-V? Interested as Manuel feels affinity with the
goals of the project, previously enjoyed working with the OpenRISC port.</li>
<li>Goal is to have a complete, fully supported, continuously updated Debian

        <time class="li-article-date">Thursday, July 7, 2016</time>
    </header>
    <section class="li-article-section">
        <p><em>Begnning on Monday, June 27th, we had a team of four University of
Cambridge undergrads begin a 10 week
internship working on the lowRISC project at the Computer Laboratory,
kindly sponsored by <a href="http://www.imc.nl/">IMC Financial Markets</a> (who are also
helping to advise this project). The team will be blogging regularly over the
course of the summer - I&rsquo;ll pass over to them to introduce
themselves.</em></p>

<p>After some initial brainstorming, we decided to aim to extend the
current lowRISC SoC design to enable video output, with the final goal of
playing video smoothly at a resolution of 640x480 on FPGA. The photo below
shows the four of us (left to right: Gary Guo, Profir-Petru Pârțachi, Alistair Fisher,
Nathanael Davison).</p>

<p><img src="/blog/2016/imc_lowrisc_interns_potatocam.jpg" alt="2016 lowRISC/IMC 
internship team" style="width: 450px;"/></p>

<p>The final goal has been decomposed into several milestones: adding VGA
functionality to lowRISC, adding an in-memory framebuffer, implementing a
video codec for RISC-V and designing and creating a 2D accelerator to speed
up video decoding. Our plan for the augmented SoC architecture is
shown the in the diagram below:</p>

<p><img src="/blog/2016/imc_lowrisc_vga_diagram_week1.png" alt="Drawing" style="width: 650px;"/></p>

<p>In our first week, we&rsquo;ve succeeded in adding VGA output to lowRISC, a
demonstration of this is shown in the video below. The demo shows lowRISC
instantiated on a Nexys4 DDR board (Artix-7) displaying a static image
that has been loaded into its BRAM. This image is read from SD card by a
bare-metal program on the RISC-V application core, which then loads it in to
the memory-mapped BRAM we hooked up to the AXI-Lite bus. The on-chip BRAM
is obviously a very limited resource, so our next step is to use the
board&rsquo;s DRAM to hold the framebuffer and make use of the BRAM for a
line-buffer.</p>

<iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/256wh1QOuH0" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen></iframe>

<p>We aim to publish something every week, either in the form of a blog post
like this or as a more detailed guide showing how to repeat our work. Next
week we&rsquo;ll share a guide on how to enable VGA in lowRISC. By the end
of the summer, as well as a working technical demo, we will also have
produced detailed documentation on the whole process of adding a
customised accelerator to lowRISC.</p>

        <p>Our friends and collaborators at the <a href="http://fossi-foundation.org/">Free and Open Source Silicon
Foundation</a> have launched the <a href="http://librecores.org/designcontest">LibreCores design
contest</a>. This is a student design
contest which aims to recognise and reward contributions to the open source
hardware ecosystem. The main evaluation criteria are:</p>

<ul>
<li>Openness. Your work must be published under an established Open Source
license.</li>
<li>Reusability. How easily can your work be used and modified by someone else?
Is it well documented? Do you plan to continue to work on your project and help
others to get started?</li>
<li>Usefulness. Is your work filling a much-needed gap in the world of Open
Source hardware design? Something that was not there before?</li>
</ul>

<p>See the <a href="http://librecores.org/designcontest">design contest site</a> for full
details. The deadline for submission is August 31st, 2016. Entrants will have
the opportunity to present their work at <a href="http://openrisc.io/orconf/">ORConf</a>,
with some travel funding available thanks to the sponsors.</p>

<p>This neatly leads me to the next activity I wanted to highlight in this post.
Again, thanks to the hard work of our friends at FOSSi, registration is <a href="http://openrisc.io/orconf/">now
open for ORConf 2016</a>. To quote that page: &ldquo;ORCONF
is an open source digital design and embedded systems conference, covering
areas of electronics from the transistor level up to Linux user space and
beyond.  Expect presentations and discussion on free and open source IP
projects, implementations on FPGA and in silicon, verification, EDA tools,
licensing and embedded software&rdquo;.</p>

<p><a href="http://openrisc.io/orconf/2015/">Last year&rsquo;s ORConf</a> was the biggest and most
enthusiastic event focused on open source digital design I&rsquo;ve ever been to,
and saw the birth of the FOSSi Foundation. Please do register to attend and
submit talks. With the growing interest in open source hardware and open
source digital logic design, I expect it will be even bigger and better than
last year. ORConf 2016 will be held at the University of Bologna in Italy
between October 7th and October 9th. <a href="http://openrisc.io/orconf/">Register
now</a>.</p>

<li>Look for freedom of design. Want to free migrate between FPGAs, structured
ASICs, standard cell ASICs</li>
<li>Want to make it easier to migrate FPGAs to ASICs for advantages in price,
performance, power, IP protection.</li>
<li>Roa Logic&rsquo;s RV32I/64 implementations are called RV11 and RV22. RV11 is
in-order, single-issue, single thread. RV22 is in-order, dual-issue and dual
thread.</li>
<li>Implement a &lsquo;folded&rsquo; optimizing 5-stage pipeline, where some classic RISC
stages are folded together for performance improvement. e.g. the instruction
decode stage decides if the instruction sequence can be optimized.</li>
<li>Ported a debug unit for or1k from OpenCores</li>
<li>Mostly target the eASIC nextreme platform. Start with an existing FPGA
design, then transfer.</li>
<li>Achieved Fmax of 649MHz (32-bit core) on a nextreme-3, vs 114MHz on the customer&rsquo;s
current CYCLONE-V. Achieved a 70% power reduction.</li>
<li>Next steps are to improve resource utilization, increase offering of

<li>Some memory access optimizations have been implemented to allow access to
AXI peripherals in one clock cycle.</li>
<li>Implemented (or implementing?) the multi-core debug protocol, potentially
supported by Trace32 (Lauterbach).</li>
</ul>

<ul>
<li>Process scaling has helped massively for data transfer within a chip, but
we&rsquo;ve had little improvement for moving data off-chip.</li>
<li>The I/O wall involves being both power and pin limited. Silicon photonics
may help overcome this.</li>
<li>Started by tring to provide DRAM connected by photonics (as part of the
DARPA POEM project).</li>
<li>What about the foundry? Do it without a foundry. How to connect electronics
and photonics? Put them on the same chip. Where are you going to get a
processor? RISC-V!</li>
<li>They produced it and it was published in Nature last month. Dual-core
1.65GHz RISC-V. Manufactured in a commercial SOI process.</li>
<li>Build a waveguide with planar silicon processing. Silicon is the high-index
core. Oxides form the low-index cladding.</li>
<li>Transmitter is driven by a CMOS logic inverter. 5Gb/s data rate at 30fj/b.</li>
<li>Issue with ring resonators is massive variation based on process and
temperature variation. Need to stabilise this some-how. Add thermal tuning.</li>
<li>To demonstrate the optical memory system, had a second chip emulating a DRAM
controller.</li>
<li>We proposed an architecture, built it, and got performance competitive to
our predictions!</li>

<h2 id="untethering-the-risc-v-rocket-chip-wei-song:541250aa31d27f4326ef7f42e9e3ae89">Untethering the RISC-V Rocket Chip: Wei Song</h2>

<ul>
<li>Rocket is an open-source SoC generator from Berkeley. The base Rocket core
is a <sup>5</sup>&frasl;<sub>6</sub> stage single-issue in-order processor.</li>
<li>Previously an host-target interface was connected to the L2 bus which
communicates with an ARM core on the Zynq to provide peripherals.</li>
<li>The untethered Rocket chip adds a separate I/O bus. Currently uses Xilinx IP
for peripherals. First stage bootloader is on FPGA block RAM, second stage
bootloader is loaded from SD. I/O read and write are totally uncached.</li>
<li>The top-level (including I/O devices) is all in System Verilog. There is a
separate &lsquo;Chisel island&rsquo; containing the Rocket interface.</li>
<li>The I/O and memory maps can be configured by CSRs.</li>
<li>The first-stage bootloader copies the second stage to DRAM, performing an
uncached copy. It then remaps the DRAM to memory address 0, resets Rocket and
starts the second stage. The second stage uses a version of the Berkeley
bootloader. It starts multi-core, VM support, then loads and boots RISC-V
Linux in a virtual address space.</li>
<li>Currently the second stage bootloader stays resident to handle HTIF
requests.</li>
<li>Our code release contains a very detailed tutorial. Key features include
support for the Nexys4 as well as the more expensive KC705. You can also use
Verilator for simulation and a free WebPACK Vivado license.</li>
<li>The code release includes a rewritten TileLink/NASTI interface, DDR2/3
controller, SD, UART.</li>
<li>Future work: re-integrate tagged memory, remove HTIF from Linux kernel (help
wanted), interrupt controller, trace debugger (Stefan Wallentowitz),
run-control debug (SiFive), platform spec.</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="mit-s-riscy-expedition-andy-wright:541250aa31d27f4326ef7f42e9e3ae89">MIT&rsquo;s RISCY expedition: Andy Wright</h2>

<ul>
<li>MIT implemented an IMAFD 64-bit RISC-V processor in Bluespec System Verilog.
It supports machine, supervisor, and user modes, boots Linux, and has been
tandem-verified with Spike.</li>
<li>Want to work on formal specification of the ISA, formally verified processor
implementations, memory consistency models, accelerators, microarchitecture
exploration, VLSI implementations using a standard ASIC flow.</li>
<li>Philosophy: get a working processor first, figure out why it&rsquo;s slow, and
make it faster without breaking it.</li>
<li>Moving to work on formal verification, which requests a formal specification
for RISC-V. Lots of questions to be answered, e.g. whether referenced bits in
page table entries should be set for speculatively accessed pages.</li>
<li>A single instruction can result in up to 13 effective memory accesses - how
do these interact with each other, and how do they influence the memory model?</li>
<li>Want simple operational definitions where legal behaviours can be observable
on a simple abstract machine consisting of cores and a shared monolithic
memory.</li>
<li>Looked at defining WMM, a new easy-to-specify weak consistency model.</li>
<li>Propose there should be a new instruction similar to sfence.vm, but going in
the opposite direction.</li>
<li>See also <a href="http://csg.csail.mit.edu/riscy-e/">their website</a>.</li>
<li>Question: will it be open source? Concerned currently because some aspects
of the design are used as challenges for student projects and releasing it
could compromise the projects.</li>

<h2 id="pydgin-for-risc-v-a-fast-and-productive-instruction-set-simulator-berkin-ilbeyi:541250aa31d27f4326ef7f42e9e3ae89">Pydgin for RISC-V, a fast and productive instruction-set simulator: Berkin Ilbeyi</h2>

<ul>
<li>Simple interpreted instruction set simulators get 1-10MIPS of performance.
Typical dynamic binary translation may achieve 100s of MIPS, with QEMU
achieving up to 1000 MIPS.</li>
<li>Another aspect worthy of consideration is productivity when working with the
simulator, for instance when looking to extend it to explore new hardware
features. Can you achieve high developer productivity and runtime performance?</li>
<li>Observe there are similar productivity-performance challenges for building
high performance language runtimes as for simulators. e.g. the PyPy project.</li>
<li>Pydgin uses PyPy&rsquo;s RPython framework.</li>
<li>Pydgin describes its own architectural description language (really a Python
DSL).</li>
<li>Pydgin running on a standard Python interpreter gives ~100KIPS. But when
going through RPython this gives 10MIPS. When targeting the RPython JIT,
adding extra RPython JIT hints are added achieved up to a 23x performance
improvement over no annotations.</li>
<li>Performs 2-3x better than Spike for many workloads. Spike caches decoded
instructions and uses PC-indexed dispatch to improve performance.</li>
<li>Achieved a 100MIPS+ RISC-V port after 9 days of development.</li>
<li>Pydgin is used in the Cornell research group to gain statistics for
software-defined regions, experimentations with data-structure specialisation,
control and memory divergence for SIMD, and more.</li>
<li>Pydgin is <a href="https://github.com/cornell-brg/pydgin">online at Github</a>.</li>

<ul>
<li>ORCA is completely open-source. See it <a href="https://github.com/cornell-brg/pydgin">at
Github</a>.</li>
<li>Initially targeted the Lattice iCE40 (3.5kLUTs, under $5 in low quantities).</li>
<li>RV32M implemented in 2kLUTs at around 20MHz on the iCE40.</li>
<li>ORCA is highly parameterized, ideally suitable for FPGAs, portable across
FPGA vendors, and BSD-licensed.</li>
<li>Achieved 244MHz, 212MIPS on an Altera Stratix-V. Lots of room for further
improvements.</li>
<li>Clock speed is close to matching the picorv32 clock speed, but with higher
DMIPS/MHz.</li>
<li>Found 64-bit vs 32-bit counters added a lot of area.</li>
<li>A good FPGA implementation often leads to a good ASIC implementation, but a
good ASIC implementation often leads to a poor FPGA implementation.</li>
<li>Use dual-ported block RAMS on the FPGA for the register file.</li>
<li>Observe that reduced register count in RV32E makes no difference for FPGAs.
Divide is very expensive.</li>
<li>Beware when writing software, a shift could be as slow as 1b/cycle.</li>
<li>The privileged architecture spec contains too many CSRs and the 64bit
counters are too big, putting pressure on multiplexers. For FPGAs, perhaps
defined small/med/full versions.</li>
</ul>

<ul>
<li>PULP and PULPino developed at ETH Zurich and University of Bologna with many
partners.</li>
<li>Develop an ultra low power processor for computing IoT. Explot parallelism
using multiple small simple cores organised in clusters.</li>
<li>Share memory within the cluster.</li>
<li>Support near-threshold operation for very low power.</li>
<li>PULP has been taped out over a dozen times across multiple process
technologies, down to 28nm.</li>
<li>PULP has a large number of IPs. To start with, open source PULPino as a
starting point.</li>
<li>PULPino is a microcontroller-style platform. No caches, no memory hierarchy,
no DMA. It re-uses IP from the PULP project and will be taped out in 65nm UMC.</li>
<li>The boot ROM loads a program from SPI flash.</li>
<li>Motivated to switch to RISC-V due to more modern design (no set flags, no
delay slot), compressed instructions, easily extensible.</li>
<li>Looking to extend RISC-V with non-standard extensions for hardware loops,
post-increment load+store, multiply-accumulate, ALU extensions (min, max
absolute value).</li>
<li>RI5CY core has full support for RV32I, implements just the mul from RV32M.
It has a 4 stage pipeline.</li>
<li>Performed a comparison based on published Cortex M4 numbers. RI5CY is a
little faster and a little smaller.</li>
<li>The RI5CY core itself is just 7% of the area of a PULPino SoC (assuming
32KiB instruction and data RAM).</li>
<li>Open source release will follow shortly, including a FreeRTOS port. Using
the Solderpad license. Just awaiting final approval from the University
(expected by the end of the month).</li>
<li>Want to port PULPino to IP-XACT. Also want to add floating point support,
branch prediction, and evaluate further non-standard ISA extensions.</li>

<ul>
<li>An out-of-order core. It&rsquo;s synthesizable, parameterizable, and open-source.</li>
<li>Out-of-order is great for tolerating variable latencies, finding
instruction-level parallelism, and working with poor compilers or lazily
written code.</li>
<li>Downsides are it&rsquo;s more complex and potentially expensive in area and power.</li>
<li>Should work as an interesting baseline for micro-architecture research. Also
enables research that need and out of order core (e.g. on memory systems,
accelerators, VLSI methodologies).</li>
<li>BOOM implements IMAFD and the RV64G+ privileged spec.</li>
<li>The RISC-V ISA is easy to implement. Relaxed memory model, accrued FP
exception flags, no integer side-effects (e.g. condition codes), no cmov or
predication, no implicit register specifiers, rs1+rs2+rs3+rd are always in the
same space allowing decode and rename to proceed in parallel.</li>
<li>As Rocket-chip gets better, so does BOOM.</li>
<li>The host-target interface is being removed from rocket-chip to provide an
untethered system.</li>
<li>BOOM has a unified physical register file (floating point and integer).</li>
<li>Masses of parameters can be tweaked.</li>
<li>2-wide BOOM with 16KiB L1 caches 1.2mm2 in TSMC 45nm. Can clock at 1.5GHz
for two-wide.</li>
<li>Currently designed for single-cycle SRAM access as the critical path.</li>
<li>Planning on a tapeout later this year.</li>
<li>Achieve 50MHz on an FPGA where the bottleneck is the FPGA tools can&rsquo;t
register-rename the FPU.</li>
<li>BOOM is 9kloc, plus 11kloc from Rocket.</li>
<li>9% CoreMarks/MHz for ARM Cortex-A9 with similar architectural parameters and
smaller (but lacking the NEON unit). Power is also similar based on public
numbers.</li>
<li>Don&rsquo;t yet have a SPEC score. Need more DRAM on the FPGA and DRAM emulation.
With a cluster of FPGAs, this should only take about a day to run.</li>
<li>BOOM-chip is currently a branch of rocket-chip. See the slides for how to
get going.</li>
<li>Currently test/verify using riscv-tests, coremark, spec, and the
riscv-torture tool.</li>
<li>riscv-torture, a randomised test generator was open-sourced yesterday. If it
finds a bug, it will minimise the program for you.</li>
<li>A design document is a work in progress up on github.com/ccelio (doesn&rsquo;t
seem to be published yet?)</li>
<li>Want to grow a community of &ldquo;baby BOOMers&rdquo; :)</li>

<ul>
<li>Bluespec&rsquo;s &lsquo;RISC-V Factory&rsquo; is aimed at organisations who want to create
their own RISC-V based CPUs or SoCs without the usual learning curve, startup
costs, and ownership costs.</li>
<li>Currently working with Draper on the DOVER project we&rsquo;ll be hearing about in
the next talk.</li>
<li>The Flute RISC-V CPU has interfaces for direct GDB control, an elastic
(latency-insensitive) pipeline, hooks for optional tagged data.</li>
<li>Have components such as interconnect, memory controller, DMA engine,
devices. Working on flash for booting and Ethernet.</li>
<li>Provide a complete development and verification environment.</li>

<ul>
<li>Current computer systems are insecure, and the processor architecture
contributes by blinding running code and making the secure and safe thing
expensive.</li>
<li>Add software defined metadata processing as implemented in PUMP.</li>
<li>Give each word a programmable tag. This is indivisible from a word and its
interpretation is programmable.</li>
<li>PUMP is a function from (Opcode, PCtag, Instrtag, RS1tag, RS2tag, MRtag) to
(Allowed?, PCtag, Resulttag).</li>
<li>Possible policies include access control, types, fine-grained instruction
permissions, memory safety, control flow integrity, taint tracking and
information flow control.</li>
<li>Rules are installed by software on PUMP misses. This demands metadata
structures be immutable.</li>
<li>A metadata tag can be a pointer, meaning it can point to a data structure of
arbitrary size.</li>
<li>Can support composite policies. i.e. no limit of only one policy at once.</li>
<li>There are no instructions to read or write metadata, i.e. no set-tag or read
tag. All tag manipulation is done through the PUMP.</li>
<li>In RISC-V use PUMP CSRs for rule inputs and outputs.</li>
<li>Compared to lowRISC: lowRISC has a limited number of tag bits, tags are
accessible to user code. Good for self-protection safety but argue it&rsquo;s not
adequate to enforce policies against malicious code (i.e. code actively trying
to circumvent protection).</li>
<li>Compare to Oracle M7. M7 has a limited number of colors and a fixed policy.</li>
<li>Have some global tags and rules so they have the same meaning across
different processes.</li>
<li>Idiosyncrasies about RISC-V: one instruction uses RS3, sparse opcode space
increases table size, multiple instructions per machine word (policies want
tagged instructions)</li>
<li>Draper plans to make available Bluespec RISC-V and metadata changes, PUMP,
set of basic micropolicies, runtime support and tools all under open source
licenses.</li>
<li>Building a consortium around Dover, an &ldquo;Inherently Secure Processing Hive&rdquo;.</li>
<li>Question: what is the overhead? Don&rsquo;t have figures yet for RISC-V. From
previous work, have 10% area overhead and twice the area, 60% energy overhead.</li>

<p>The <a href="https://riscv.org/2015/12/prelim-agenda-3rd-risc-v-workshop/">third RISC-V workshop</a> is going
on today and tomorrow at the Oracle Conference Center, California. I&rsquo;ll be
keeping a semi-live blog of talks and announcements throughout the day. See

<ul>
<li>Save the date, the 4th RISC-V workshop will be July 12th-13th at the MIT
CSAIL/Stata Center.</li>
<li>In August 2015, articles of incorporation were filed to create a non-profit
RISC-V Foundation to govern the ISA.</li>
<li>RISC-V Foundation mission statement: The RISC-V Foundation is a non-profit
consortium chartered to standardize, protect, and promote the free and open
RISC-V instruction set architecture together with its hardware and software
ecosystem for use in all computing devices.</li>
<li>The RISC-V ISA and related standards shall remain open and license-free to
all parties.</li>
<li>The compatibility test suites shall always be publicly available as a source
code download.</li>
<li>To protect the standard, only members (with commercial RISC-V products) of
the Foundation in good standing can use &ldquo;RISC-V&rdquo; and associated trademarks,
and only for devices that pass the tests in the open-source compatibility
suites maintained by the Foundation.</li>
<li>Drafting a new license for the ISA &lsquo;combining the best of BSD, GPL and so
on&rsquo;.</li>
<li>The Foundation will have a board of 7 directors elected by the members. All
members of committees must be members of the RISC-V Foundation.</li>
<li>All details of the foundation are a work in progress. Feedback is welcome!</li>
<li>16 member companies so far. Bluespec, Draper, Google, Hewlett Packard Labs,
Microsemi, Oracle, SiFive, antmicro, codasip, Gray Research, Lattice
Semiconductor, lowRISC, ROA logic, Rumble Development, Syntacore, Technolution</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="risc-v-updates-krste-asanovic:404bdd89395af7de00a88d5e9af98f5d">RISC-V Updates: Krste Asanovic</h2>

<ul>
<li>The 1.9 version of the compressed extension is on track to become frozen and
become blessed as v2.0. Now is the time to speak up if you have any feedback
or concerns!</li>
<li>Privileged architecture 1.7 was released in May 2015 and has received a lot
of feedback. Hope to release an updated draft addressing feedback in the next
month or two. Doubt it will really settle down before the summer, as it needs
more OS and driver development against it.</li>
<li>&lsquo;V&rsquo; Vector Extension: not yet ready to release a draft for this workshop,
but the RTL of the HWacha vector coprocessor has been open-sourced along with
3 tech-reports.</li>
<li>Hwacha is NOT the V extensions. It&rsquo;s a research project designed to push the
limits of in-order decoupled data-parallel accelerators (e.g. GPUs). The
microarchitecture does demonstrate some of the ideas that will appear in V.</li>
<li>Ongoing ISA research at UCB: virtual local store (VLS, Henry Cook&rsquo;s 2009
master&rsquo;s thesis) and user-level DMA (copying data between DRAM and VLS
directly).</li>
<li>New Berkeley open-source cores: BOOM out-of-order implementation and V-Scale
(verilog implementation of Z-Scale).</li>
<li>RISC-V is being transitioned out of Berkeley. This involves upstreaming of
tools and the RISC-V Foundation taking over the standards process.</li>
<li>SiFive has been founded by some of the lead RISC-V developers (Krste
Asanovic, Yunsup Lee, Andrew Waterman). Sutter Hill Ventures have invested.</li>
<li>Most urgent outstanding issues: holes and ambiguities in the specification
and the platform specification.</li>
<li>Holes in the spec: floating-point NaNs (resolved and updated), CSR
read/write semantics (resolved, updated spec), memory model (far from
resolved), Hypervisor support (no proposal). A formal spec of the whole ISA
and memory model is desired.</li>
<li>Although RISC-V was designed in reusable layers, some concrete standards for
hardware platforms are desirable e.g. memory maps, interrupt controller, power
management. To what extent can platform specs be shared across
microcontroller-class, application cores, and rack-scale designs?</li>
</ul>

<ul>
<li>Goals: a debug system that works for everybody with a working system done by
July 1st 2016.</li>
<li>The specification will be submitted to the RISC-V Foundation and there are
plans for an open source release of the debugger and implementations for
Rocket and Z-Scale.</li>
<li>Status: the specification is mostly complete.</li>
<li>Features: (many, see the slides). Interested in tracing core execution to on
or off-chip RAM and providing a framework to debug any component on the
system, not just the RISC-V cores.</li>
<li>The debug transport module provides access to the system bus. It implements
a message queue and optional authentication.</li>
<li>New CSRs will be added and exposed on the system bus.</li>
<li>The spec describes a small amount of debug memory (1KiB ROM) and 8-16 bytes
of RAM. This memory is not cached and is shared between all cores.</li>
<li>Up to 4095 hardware breakpoints supported (but 4 is more typical). Each may
support exact address match, address range match, exact data match, data range
match, &hellip;</li>
<li>The work-in-progress spec will be posted to the hw-dev RISC-V mailing list
later today. Comments very welcome.</li>
<li>Question: how does this map to gdb&rsquo;s capabilities? Are there things it can
do but gdb can&rsquo;t or vice-versa? It&rsquo;s not a 1:1 match but should be a superset
of what gdb can do.</li>
<li>Question: how does the tracing scale? Hasn&rsquo;t be investigated yet.</li>
<li>Question: will support be integrated into the BOOM codebase? Answer: not
currently planned.</li>
<li>Question: there&rsquo;s a wide spectrum of functionality that different
implementations could implement. Is there a discovery mechanism for the
functionality that is supported? Yes.</li>

<h2 id="risc-v-in-axiom-michael-gielda:404bdd89395af7de00a88d5e9af98f5d">RISC-V in Axiom: Michael Gielda</h2>

<ul>
<li>Axiom is a fully open source 4K film camera design. It is an EU Horizon 2020
project with multiple partners.</li>
<li>Aim of Axiom is to create an extensible open source platform that is also a
desirable project in itself. The aim is to open up what is currently a fairly
closed industry and lower barriers of entry to new players. There is an
obvious parallel to the RISC-V and lowRISC projects.</li>
<li>Chose the largest Zynq FPGA that had zero-cost tool support to maximise the
number of people who can hack on the design.</li>
<li>Using the Z-Scale as a soft-core for communication between the FPGA
pre-processing board (Kintex-7) and the FPGA SoC main board with a dual-core
Cortex-A9 (Zynq 7030).</li>
<li>Long-term goals are to ensure the design can be reused through
parameterisation, and look at broadening adoption of the Chisel design
methodology.</li>
<li>The Axiom Gamma project is almost half-way done. There will be an EU
technical review in March at which point it should be working.</li>

<ul>
<li>Should HPC take inspiration from the embedded market?</li>
<li>Is building an SoC for HPC a good idea? HPC is power limited
(performance/Watt) which arguably means HPC and embedded requirements are
aligned.</li>
<li>From a previous project case study (Green Wave), they found an embedded SoC
design was performance/power competitive with Fermi. This had a 12x12 2D
on-chip torus network with 676 compute cores, 33 supervisor cores, 1 PCI
express interface, 8 Hybrid Memory Cube interfaces, &hellip;</li>
<li>Proposed an FPGA-implemented SoC for HPC. This contains 4 Z-scale processors
with a 2x2 concentrated mesh with 2 virtual channels. The Z-Scale was chosen
for area-efficiency on FPGA.</li>
<li>The network is implemented using the <a href="https://github.com/LBL-CoDEx/OpenSoCFabric">OpenSoC
fabric</a> (open source and in
chisel). AHB endpoints have now beed added and AXI is in-development.</li>
<li>A 96-core system was constructed using multiple FPGAs.</li>

<h2 id="grvi-phalanx-a-massively-parallel-risc-v-fpga-accelerator-jan-gray:404bdd89395af7de00a88d5e9af98f5d">GRVI Phalanx. A massively parallel RISC-V FPGA accelerator: Jan Gray</h2>

<ul>
<li>GRVI is pronounced &lsquo;groovy&rsquo;.</li>
<li>There&rsquo;s lots of interest in FPGA accelerators right now (Altera acquisition,
MSR&rsquo;s catapult).</li>
<li>FPGAs are an interesting platform. Massively parallel. Specialized.
Connected. High throughput. Low latency. The big barrier is of course porting
your software. Jan argues OpenCL for FPGAs is a major breakthrough for this
problem, if you&rsquo;re lucky enough to have an application that can be expressed
in OpenCL.</li>
<li>Phalanx is an accelerator accelerator - an infrastructure making it easier
to run you application on an FPGA and connect everything together. It is
composed of processor+accelerator clusters+NoC.</li>
<li>Jan&rsquo;s Razor: &ldquo;In a CMP, cut inessential resources from each CPU, to maximize
CPUs per die.&rdquo;</li>
<li>Jan has achieved an RV32I datapath in about 250 LUTs. This core can achieve
300-375MHz, 1.3-1.6CPI. The &lsquo;GRVI&rsquo; core is ~320 6-LUTs so &ldquo;1 MIPS/LUT&rdquo;.</li>
<li>How many can you fit on a modern FPGA? The limiting resource is really the
block RAMs. In a cluster, two processing elements can share an instruction
BRAM, and all PEs can share a cluster memory.</li>
<li>How should the clusters be interconnected? A 5-port virtual channel router
might be a sensible choice in an ASIC, but does not map well to an FPGA.
Instead use a <a href="http://fpga.org/2015/09/03/introducing-hoplite/">Hoplite</a> 2D
router. This is only 1% of the area x delay product of FPGA-optimized VC
routers. Each cluster has a 300 bit connection to the Hoplite router (with a
256bit payload).</li>
<li>400 of the GRVI Phalanx PEs can fit on a Xilinx KU040. The amortized cost of
the router per processor is only 40 LUTs.</li>
<li>Can fit 32 GRVI Phalanx PEs on an Artix-7-35T.</li>
<li>Want to support different accelerated parallel programming models: SPMD,
MIMD, MP. All potentially accelerated by custom GRVI And cluster fucntion
units, custom memory or interconnects, custom accelerators on the NOC.</li>
<li>Next steps: debug/trace over NoC, Hoplite/AXI4 bridges, OpenCL stack,
potential bridge to Chisel RISC-V infrastructure?</li>
<li>Question: how do I get this? Not available yet, and not yet sure on the
licensing model.</li>

<ul>
<li>Initializing the stuff outside the main CPU on a chromebook takes about 1
billion instructions before it can start Linux.</li>
<li>Firmware, 1990-2005 &ldquo;fire and forget&rdquo;. Set al lthe stff kernels can&rsquo;t do
(e.g. LinuxBIOS), then get out of the way. But now there&rsquo;s a push for the
firmware to hang around after boot.</li>
<li>Ron argues this sucks. It&rsquo;s slow, there&rsquo;s no easy bugfix path, and it&rsquo;s not
SMP capable on x86.</li>
<li>Why doesn&rsquo;t Ron like persistent firmware? It&rsquo;s another attack vector,
indistinguishable from a persistent embedded threat. Ron&rsquo;s preference is the
platform management code run as a kernel thread. Minion cores are ideal for
this (Ron&rsquo;s words rather than mine - I of course agree whole-heartedly).</li>
<li>coreboot is a GPLv2 BIOS replacement (not a bootloader). It has multiple
possible payloads including SeaBIOS and depthcharge (used for verified boot on
Chromebooks).</li>
<li>Port was started in October 2014 as a side project. The effort resumed in
July 2015 with the privileged spec, and as-of September is up and running
again. The most recent port runs on Spike but not QEMU (due to lack of support
for the privileged spec).</li>
<li>RISC-V is a first class citizen in coreboot, all commits must pass tests for
the RISC-V buildbot.</li>
<li>src/arch/riscv is 2685 LoC.</li>
<li>The Federal Office for Information Security in Germany runs a hardware test
station for coreboot. As soon as real hardware is running, they&rsquo;ve offered to
integrate it into their system.</li>
<li>Lessons learned

<ul>
<li>provide a boot time SRAM (make sure the address is fixed and not aliased
by DRAM once DRAM is up).</li>
<li>Provide a serial port.</li>
<li>Ron reiterates that runtime functions belong in the kernel, not persistent
firmware.</li>
<li>Firmware tables always need translation by kernel, so make them text not
binary.</li>
<li>Keep the mask ROM as simple as possible.</li>
<li>Don&rsquo;t cheap out on SPI or flash part size. Just plan a 64MiB part.</li>
<li>Don&rsquo;t reset the chipset on IE device not present.</li>

<ul>
<li>There is a UEFI Forum consistent of a board of 12 directors, 12 promoters,
42 contributors, 213 adopters.</li>
<li>UEFI and ACPI are both now handled by the UEFI Forum.</li>
<li>A RISC-V UEFI port is taking place using EDKII (EFI Development Kit II) and
OVMF (Open Virtual Machine Firmware).</li>
<li>The speakers are giving a very thorough description of the UEFI boot
mechanism which I&rsquo;m not able to do justice. You&rsquo;re best waiting for the
slides+video I&rsquo;m afraid.</li>
<li>The project was started a few months ago, and can now boot to a UEFI shell.</li>
<li>They have created a new RISC-V QEMU target with some PC peripherals (CMOS,
PM, PCI and other devices), and also implemented RISC-V machine mode.</li>
<li>Requests for new RISC-V spec additions: a periodic timer CSR, RTC with alarm
CSR, PI management mode support, &hellip; (sorry, missed some).</li>

<ul>
<li>FreeBSD will support RV64I in release 11.0.</li>
<li>Why use FreeBSD? Among other reasons, it gives a full-stack BSD license
(RISC-V, FreeBSD, LLVM/Clang).</li>
<li>FreeBSD has been brought up on Spike.</li>
<li>The early boot assembly code will put the hardware in a known state, build a
ring buffer for interrupts, initialise the page tables, enable the MMU, then
finally branch to a virtual address and call into C code.</li>
<li>Userspace porting required modifications to jemalloc, csu (crt1.S, crtn.S,
crti.S), libc, msun (libm), rtld-elf (the runtime linker).</li>
<li>The FreeBSD port is based on the ARMv8 port. It has a 25k line diff and took
6 months from scratch.</li>
<li>Userland started working in December. Support will now be committed to
FreeBSD SVN.</li>
<li>Next plans include multicore, FPU, increasing the virtual address space,
DTrace, performance monitoring counters, QEMU, &hellip;</li>
<li>Proposed changes: split sptbr to sptrbr0 and sptbr1 for the user VA and the
kernel VA. This means there is no need to change SPTBR when changing the
privilege level, and should reduce code size.</li>

<h2 id="building-the-risc-v-software-ecosystem-arun-thomas:404bdd89395af7de00a88d5e9af98f5d">Building the RISC-V software ecosystem: Arun Thomas</h2>

<ul>
<li>&ldquo;2016 is the year of RISC-V&rdquo;. Or at least, the year of RISC-V software. We
have a great opportunity to push the software stack forwards.</li>
<li>What can we achieve by the end of the year? Hopefully upstereamed GNU
toolchain and QEMU. More mature Clang/LLVM support, upstreamed OS support,
Debian/RISC-V port, start thinking about Android and a real-time OS.</li>
<li>How do we get there? We need to recruit more RISC-V developers and make it
easier for people to get started by producing more docs and specifications.</li>
<li>Right now, the RISC-V Github has had 48 contributors from a wide range of
Universities, companies and OSS projects.</li>
<li>We should present talks and tutorials at developer conferences and local
user group meetings.</li>
<li>If you have local patches, upstream them!</li>
<li>How to attract developers? Could fund developers/projects via the
Foundation, apply to be a Google Summer of Code mentoring organization, update
the list of open bugs and future requests on github and track contribution
statistics.</li>
<li>We can make it much easier for people to get started by building Debian
packages, upstreaming, and providing regular binary snapshots.</li>
<li>Spike is great for prototyping hardware features, but QEMU is a better tool
for software development and a critical part of the RISC-V software story.</li>
<li>There&rsquo;s more to specify. e.g. a platform specification (e.g. ARMv8 Server
Base System Architecture), boot architecture (look at the ARMv8 Server Base
Boot Requirements), RISC-V ABI, hypervisor, security.</li>
<li>Useful documents include a RISC-V Assembly Guide, some equivalent of the ARM
Cortex-A Programmer&rsquo;s Guide, and a New Contributor&rsquo;s Guide.</li>

        <h2><a href="http://www.lowrisc.org/blog/2015/12/untethered-lowrisc-release">Untethered lowRISC release </a></h2>
        <time class="li-article-date">Friday, December 18, 2015</time>
    </header>
    <section class="li-article-section">
        <p>Over the past several months, we&rsquo;ve been working to provide a standalone or
&lsquo;untethered&rsquo; SoC. Cores in the original <a href="https://github.com/ucb-bar/rocket-chip">Rocket
chip</a> rely on communicating with a
companion processor via the host-target interface (HTIF) to access peripherals
and I/O. This release removes this requirement, adding an I/O bus and
instantiating FPGA peripherals. The accompanying <a href="http://www.lowrisc.org/docs/untether-v0.2/">tutorial</a>, written by Wei Song, describes how to
build this code release and explains the underlying structural changes. We
support both the <a href="http://www.xilinx.com/products/boards-and-kits/ek-k7-kc705-g.html">Xilinx
KC705</a> and
the lower-priced <a href="http://store.digilentinc.com/nexys-4-ddr-artix-7-fpga-trainer-board-recommended-for-ece-curriculum/">Nexys4
DDR</a>
development boards. We would gladly welcome assistance in supporting other
boards.</p>

<p>Please note that the codebase temporarily lacks support for tagged memory
included in the <a href="http://www.lowrisc.org/docs/tagged-memory-v0.1/">previous release</a>. We plan to re-integrate tagged memory support
with additional optimisations early next year. You can find a detailed list of
changes in the <a href="http://www.lowrisc.org/docs/untether-v0.2/release/">release notes</a>.
One highlight is support for <a href="http://www.lowrisc.org/docs/untether-v0.2/vsim/">RTL simulation using the open-source Verilator
tool</a>.</p>

<p>This development milestone should make it easier for others to contribute. If
you&rsquo;re looking to get stuck in, you might want to consider looking at tasks
such as:</p>

<ul>
<li>Cleaning up the <a href="https://github.com/lowRISC/riscv-linux">RISC-V Linux port</a>,
improving devicetree support and removing the host-target interface.</li>
<li>Replacing use of proprietary peripheral IP with open-source IP cores.</li>
<li>Adding support for different FPGA development boards, including Altera
boards.</li>
<li>Implementing the <a href="http://www.cl.cam.ac.uk/techreports/UCAM-CL-TR-852.pdf">BERI Programmable Interrupt
Controller</a> (p73), and
adding necessary Linux support.</li>
</ul>

<p>Our next development priorities are the re-integration of tagged memory
support and an initial integration of a minion core design. We also expect to
put out a job advert in the next few weeks for a new member of the lowRISC
development team at the University of Cambridge Computer Laboratory.
Interested applicants are encouraged to make informal enquiries about the post
to Rob Mullins <a href="mailto:Robert.Mullins@cl.cam.ac.uk">Robert.Mullins@cl.cam.ac.uk</a>.</p>

<p>We hope to see many of you at the <a href="https://riscv.org/2015/12/prelim-agenda-3rd-risc-v-workshop/">3rd RISC-V
Workshop</a> in January, where Wei Song
and Alex Bradbury will be presenting about lowRISC.</p>

        <p>Please join us October 9th-11th in Geneva, Switzerland for <a href="http://openrisc.io/orconf/">ORConf
2015</a>. The event is kindly being hosted by CERN at
the <a href="http://knowledgetransfer.web.cern.ch/ideasquare/about">IdeaSquare</a>.
Last year&rsquo;s ORConf was home to the first public talk on lowRISC and we&rsquo;re
delighted this year it will also be hosting a
series of lowRISC and RISC-V discussions, serving as a European lowRISC and
RISC-V workshop. ORConf has in recent years grown to cover a range of open
source hardware topics beyond the original OpenRISC focus. Expect
presentations and discussion on free and open source IP projects,
implementations on FPGA and in silicon, verification, EDA tools, licensing and
embedded software, to name a few.</p>

<p>The event will run from 13:00 until 18:30 on Friday, 09:30 until 19:30 on
Saturday, and from 09:30 until 15:30 on Sunday. Friday will consist primarily
of breakout sessions, planning, and discussion regarding lowRISC. If you are
already contributing or your are thinking of getting involved and want to
learn more, you are very welcome to join us. If you would like to present,
do submit a proposal either via the link at the <a href="http://openrisc.io/orconf/">ORConf
website</a> or to me at asb@lowrisc.org. We hope to
see many of you there - please <a href="http://goo.gl/forms/KRZux8vnyO">register

<p>It&rsquo;s the second day of the <a href="https://riscv.org/2015/06/preliminary-agenda-for-the-2nd-risc-v-workshop-is-posted/">second RISC-V
workshop</a> today in Berkeley,
California.  I&rsquo;ll be keeping a semi-live blog of talks and announcements
throughout the day.</p>

<h2 id="z-scale-tiny-32-bit-risc-v-systems-yunsup-lee:1ef1186fa93d1e56b496df4f0f6ee20f">Z-scale. Tiny 32-bit RISC-V Systems: Yunsup Lee</h2>

<ul>
<li>Z-Scale is a family of tiny cores, similar in spirit to the ARM Cortex-M
family. It integrates with the AHB-Lite interconnect.</li>
<li>Contrast to Rocket (in-order cores, 64-bit, 32-bit, dual-issue options), and
BOOM (a family of out-of-order cores).</li>
<li>Z-Scale is a 32-bit 3-stage single-issue in-order pipeline executing the
RV32IM ISA.</li>
<li>The instruction bus and data base are 32-bit AHB-Lite buses</li>
<li>There is a plan to publish a microarchitecture specification to make it easy
for others to implement an equivalent design in the language of their choice.</li>
<li>The Zscale is slightly larger than the Cortex-M0 due to having 32 vs 16
registers, 64-bit performance counters, and a fast multiply and divide. The
plan is to add an option to generate a Zscale implementing RV32E (i.e. only
having 16 registers).</li>
<li>Zscale is only 604 loc in Chisel. 274 lines for control, 267 for the
datapath, and 63 for the top-level. Combine with 983loc borrowed from Rocket.</li>
<li>A Verilog implementation of Z-scale is being implemented. It&rsquo;s currently
1215 lines of code.</li>
<li>The repo is <a href="https://github.com/ucb-bar/zscale">here</a>, but Yunsup needs to
do a little more work to make it easily buildable. There will be a blog post
on the RISC-V site soon.</li>
<li>All future Rocket development will move to the public
<a href="https://github.com/ucb-bar/rocket-chip">rocket-chip</a> repo!</li>
<li>Memory interfaces:

<ul>
<li>TileLink is the Berkeley cache-coherent interconnect</li>
<li>NASTI (Berkeley implementation of AXI4)</li>
<li>HASTI (implementation of AHB-lite)</li>
<li>POCI (implementation of APB)</li>
</ul></li>
<li>The plan is to dump HTIF in Rocket, and add a standard JTAG debug interface.</li>
<li>Future work for Z-Scale includes a microarchitecture document, improving
performance, implementing the C extensions, adding an MMU option, and adding
more devices.</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="boom-berkeley-out-of-order-machine-chris-celio:1ef1186fa93d1e56b496df4f0f6ee20f">BOOM. Berkeley Out-of-order-Machine: Chris Celio</h2>

<ul>
<li>BOOM is a (work in progress) superscalar, out-of-order RISC-V processor
written in Chisel.</li>
<li>Chris argues there&rsquo;s been a general lack of effort in academia to build and
evaluate out-of-order designs. As he points out, much research relies on
software simulators with no area or power numbers.</li>
<li>Some of the difficult questions for BOOM are which benchmarks to use, and
how many cycles you need to run. He points out that mapping to FPGA running at
50MHz, it would take around a day for the SPEC benchmarks for a cluster of
FPGAs.</li>
<li>The fact that rs1, rs2, rs3 and rd are always in the same space in the
RISC-V ISA allows decode and rename to proceed in parallel.</li>
<li>BOOM supports the full RV64G standard. It benefits from reusing Rocket as a
library of components.</li>
<li>BOOM uses explicit renaming, with a unified register file holding both
x-regs and f-regs (floating point). A unified issue window holds all
instructions.</li>
<li>BOOM is synthesisable and hits 2GHz (30 FO4) in TSMC 45nm.</li>
<li>BOOM is 9kloc of its own code, and pulls in 11.5kloc from other libraries
(rocket, uncore, floating poing)</li>
<li>BOOM compares well to an ARM Cortex-A9 and A15 in terms of CoreMark/MHz. A
4-wide BOOM gives a similar CoreMark/MHz to the A15.</li>
<li>Future work will look at new applications, a ROCC interface, new
microarchitecture designs. The plan is to open source by this winter.</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="fabscalar-risc-v-rangeen-basu-roy-chowdhury:1ef1186fa93d1e56b496df4f0f6ee20f">Fabscalar RISC-V: Rangeen Basu Roy Chowdhury</h2>

<ul>
<li>A FabScalar RISC-V version should be released in the next few days</li>
<li>FabScalar generates synthesisable RTL for arbitrary superscalar cores with a
canonical superscalar template.</li>
<li>FabScalar uses a library of pipeline stages, providing many different
designs for each canonical pipeline stage.</li>
<li>Two chips have been built with FabScalar so far (using PISA).</li>
<li>The RISC-V port was built on the previous PIA &lsquo;Superset Core&rsquo;. This had
64-bit instructions and 32-bit address and data.</li>
<li>For RISC-V FabScalar they have a unified physical register file and unified
issue queue for floating point (so the FP ALU is treated like just another
functional unit).</li>
<li>FabScalar RISC-V will be released as an open source tool complete with
uncore components and verification infrastructure. It will be available on
GitHub in the fall.</li>
<li>The license isn&rsquo;t yet decided, but there&rsquo;s a good chance it will be BSD.</li>
</ul>

<ul>
<li>Two logical values are defined. Data and null (not data). Then define
threshold operators to produce &lsquo;null convention logic&rsquo;.</li>
<li>See <a href="https://users.soe.ucsc.edu/~scott/papers/NCL2.pdf">here</a> for more on
Null Convention Logic</li>
<li>This results in a system built entirely of combinational logic. I couldn&rsquo;t
hope to accurately summarise the work here. I&rsquo;m afraid you might be best off
waiting for the recording.</li>
<li>Current executing compiled quicksort at approximately 400mips (without
serious optimisation).</li>

<ul>
<li>Current architectures e.g. those from Intel and ARM have large errata sheets
published semi-regularly. Can we do better for RISC-V?</li>
<li>Need an unambiguous formal ISA specification which should be coupled to a
processor implementation amenable to the two, with a formal link between the
two.</li>
<li>Currently specifying RISC-V in the <a href="http://www.cl.cam.ac.uk/~acjf3/l3/">L3
DSL</a>. The interpreter is used as a
reference oracle for processor implementations.</li>
<li>The current state of the spec is <a href="https://github.com/pmundkur/l3riscv">available on
Github</a>.</li>
<li>The work has already helped to highlight some areas where clarification is
needed in the written specification</li>
<li>Next steps would involve support for the compressed instruction set and
floating point, booting Linux, and using for tandem-verification (e.g. with
Flue from Bluespec).</li>
<li>Hope to export usable HOL4 formal definitions, and use that to prove
information properties (e.g. non-interference and information flow in
low-level privileged code).</li>
<li>The talk is now moving to the second half, where Prashanth is presenting
Nirav Dave&rsquo;s work</li>
<li>This work is looking at rapidly verifying architectural and
micro-architectural variants of RISC-V. Rely on translating between
microarchitectural-states and ISA-level states.</li>

<li>Support dynamic voltage and frequency scaling on-chip with no off-chip
components.</li>
<li>Want to switch all converters simultaneously to avoid charge sharing. The
clock frequency adapts to track the voltage ripple.</li>
<li>Raven has a RISC-V scalar core, vector accelerator. 16KB scalar instruction
cache, 32KB shared data cache, and 8KB instruction cache. This has a 1.19mm^2
area.</li>
<li>The converter area is 0.19mm^2</li>
<li>The chip was wire-bonded on to a daughter-board, which was then connected to
a larger motherboard connected to a Zedboard</li>
<li>Converter transitions are less than 20ns, which allows extremely
fine-grained DVFS.</li>
<li>Raven3 showed 80% efficiency across a wide voltage range and achieved
26GFLOPS/W using the on-chip conversion.</li>

<ul>
<li>Approximately 40 people working on PULP in some way</li>
<li>Ultimate (ambitious) goal is one 1GOPS/mW (or 1pJ/op). Also hope to achieve
energy proportionality.</li>
<li>Plan is to be open source on GitHub</li>
<li>PULP has been silicon-proven in 28nm, 65nm, 130nm and 180nm. The team have
tape-outs planned through to 2016.</li>
<li>Sven has replaced the OpenRISC frontend with a RISC-V decoder, hoping to
take advantage of the more active community and compressed instruction set
support.</li>
<li>PULP is a simple 4-stage design supporting RV32IC as well as the mul
instruction from the M extension.</li>
<li>Synthesising for UMC65, they see 22kilo-gate equivalent per core</li>
<li>The OR10N core was a new OpenRISC implementation with support for hardware
loops, pre/postincrement memory access and vector instructions.</li>
<li>Heading for a GlobalFoundries 28nm tapeout in Q4 2015</li>
