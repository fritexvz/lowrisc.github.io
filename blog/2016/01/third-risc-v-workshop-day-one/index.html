<p>The <a href="http://riscv.org/workshop-jan2016.html">third RISC-V workshop</a> is going
on today and tomorrow at the Oracle Conference Center, California. I&rsquo;ll be keeping a semi-live
blog of talks and announcements throughout the day.</p>

<h2 id="introductions-and-risc-v-foundation-overview-rick-o-connor:404bdd89395af7de00a88d5e9af98f5d">Introductions and RISC-V Foundation Overview: Rick O&rsquo;Connor</h2>

<ul>
<li>Save the date, the 4th RISC-V workshop will be July 12th-13th at the MIT
CSAIL/Stata Center.</li>
<li>In August 2015, articles of incorporation were filed to create a non-profit
RISC-V Foundation to govern the ISA.</li>
<li>RISC-V Foundation mission statement: The RISC-V Foundation is a non-profit
consortium chartered to standardize, protect, and promote the free and open
RISC-V instruction set architecture together with its hardware and software
ecosystem for use in all computing devices.</li>
<li>The RISC-V ISA and related standards shall remain open and license-free to
all parties.</li>
<li>The compatibility test suites shall always be publicly available as a source
code download.</li>
<li>To protect the standard, only members (with commercial RISC-V products) of
the Foundation in good standing can use &ldquo;RISC-V&rdquo; and associated trademarks,
and only for devices that pass the tests in the open-source compatibility
suites maintained by the Foundation.</li>
<li>Drafting a new license for the ISA &lsquo;combining the best of BSD, GPL and so
on&rsquo;.</li>
<li>The Foundation will have a board of 7 directors elected by the members. All
members of committees must be members of the RISC-V Foundation.</li>
<li>All details of the foundation are a work in progress. Feedback is welcome!</li>
<li>16 member companies so far. Bluespec, Draper, Google, Hewlett Packard Labs,
Microsemi, Oracle, SiFive, antmicro, codasip, Gray Research, Lattice
Semiconductor, ROA logic, Rumble Development, Syntacore, Technolution</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="risc-v-updates-krste-asanovic:404bdd89395af7de00a88d5e9af98f5d">RISC-V Updates: Krste Asanovic</h2>

<ul>
<li>The 1.9 version of the compressed extension is on track to become frozen and
become blessed as v2.0. Now is the time to speak up if you have any feedback
or concerns!</li>
<li>Privileged architecture 1.7 was released in May 2015 and has received a lot
of feedback. Hope to release an updated draft addressing feedback in the next
month or two. Doubt it will really settle down before the summer, as it needs
more OS and driver development against it.</li>
<li>&lsquo;V&rsquo; Vector Extension: not yet ready to release a draft for this workshop,
but the RTL of the HWacha vector coprocessor has been open-sourced along with
3 tech-reports.</li>
<li>Hwacha is NOT the V extensions. It&rsquo;s a research project designed to push the
limits of in-order decoupled data-parallel accelerators (e.g. GPUs). The
microarchitecture does demonstrate some of the ideas that will appear in V.</li>
<li>Ongoing ISA research at UCB: virtual local store (VLS, Henry Cook&rsquo;s 2009
master&rsquo;s thesis) and user-level DMA (copying data between DRAM and VLS
directly).</li>
<li>New Berkeley open-source cores: BOOM out-of-order implementation and V-Scale
(verilog implementation of Z-Scale).</li>
<li>RISC-V is being transitioned out of Berkeley. This involves upstreaming of
tools and the RISC-V Foundation taking over the standards process.</li>
<li>SiFive has been founded by some of the lead RISC-V developers (Krste
Asanovic, Yunsup Lee, Andrew Waterman). Sutter Hill Ventures have invested.</li>
<li>Most urgent outstanding issues: holes and ambiguities in the specification
and the platform specification.</li>
<li>Holes in the spec: floating-point NaNs (resolved and updated), CSR
read/write semantics (resolved, updated spec), memory model (far from
resolved), Hypervisor support (no proposal). A formal spec of the whole ISA
and memory model is desired.</li>
<li>Although RISC-V was designed in reusable layers, some concrete standards for
hardware platforms are desirable e.g. memory maps, interrupt controller, power
management. To what extent can platform specs be shared across
microcontroller-class, application cores, and rack-scale designs?</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="risc-v-external-debug-aka-jtag-debugging-tim-newsome:404bdd89395af7de00a88d5e9af98f5d">RISC-V External Debug (aka JTAG debugging): Tim Newsome</h2>

<ul>
<li>Goals: a debug system that works for everybody with a working system done by
July 1st 2016.</li>
<li>The specification will be submitted to the RISC-V Foundation and there are
plans for an open source release of the debugger and implementations for
Rocket and Z-Scale.</li>
<li>Status: the specification is mostly complete.</li>
<li>Features: (many, see the slides). Interested in tracing core execution to on
or off-chip RAM and providing a framework to debug any component on the
system, not just the RISC-V cores.</li>
<li>The debug transport module provides access to the system bus. It implements
a message queue and optional authentication.</li>
<li>New CSRs will be added and exposed on the system bus.</li>
<li>The spec describes a small amount of debug memory (1KiB ROM) and 8-16 bytes
of RAM. This memory is not cached and is shared between all cores.</li>
<li>Up to 4095 hardware breakpoints supported (but 4 is more typical). Each may
support exact address match, address range match, exact data match, data range
match, &hellip;</li>
<li>The work-in-progress spec will be posted to the hw-dev RISC-V mailing list
later today. Comments very welcome.</li>
<li>Question: how does this map to gdb&rsquo;s capabilities? Are there things it can
do but gdb can&rsquo;t or vice-versa? It&rsquo;s not a 1:1 match but should be a superset
of what gdb can do.</li>
<li>Question: how does the tracing scale? Hasn&rsquo;t be investigated yet.</li>
<li>Question: will support be integrated into the BOOM codebase? Answer: not
currently planned.</li>
<li>Question: there&rsquo;s a wide spectrum of functionality that different
implementations could implement. Is there a discovery mechanism for the
functionality that is supported? Yes.</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="risc-v-in-axiom-michael-gielda:404bdd89395af7de00a88d5e9af98f5d">RISC-V in Axiom: Michael Gielda</h2>

<ul>
<li>Axiom is a fully open source 4K film camera design. It is an EU Horizon 2020
project with multiple partners.</li>
<li>Aim of Axiom is to create an extensible open source platform that is also a
desirable project in itself. The aim is to open up what is currently a fairly
closed industry and lower barriers of entry to new players. There is an
obvious parallel to the RISC-V and lowRISC projects.</li>
<li>Chose the largest Zynq FPGA that had zero-cost tool support to maximise the
number of people who can hack on the design.</li>
<li>Using the Z-Scale as a soft-core for communication between the FPGA
pre-processing board (Kintex-7) and the FPGA SoC main board with a dual-core
Cortex-A9 (Zynq 7030).</li>
<li>Long-term goals are to ensure the design can be reused through
parameterisation, and look at broadening adoption of the Chisel design
methodology.</li>
<li>The Axiom Gamma project is almost half-way done. There will be an EU
technical review in March at which point it should be working.</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="emulating-future-hpc-soc-architectures-using-risc-v-farzad-fatollahi-fard:404bdd89395af7de00a88d5e9af98f5d">Emulating future HPC SoC architectures using RISC-V: Farzad Fatollahi-Fard</h2>

<ul>
<li>Should HPC take inspiration from the embedded market?</li>
<li>Is building an SoC for HPC a good idea? HPC is power limited
(performance/Watt) which arguably means HPC and embedded requirements are
aligned.</li>
<li>From a previous project case study (Green Wave), they found an embedded SoC
design was performance/power competitive with Fermi. This had a 12x12 2D
on-chip torus network with 676 compute cores, 33 supervisor cores, 1 PCI
express interface, 8 Hybrid Memory Cube interfaces, &hellip;</li>
<li>Proposed an FPGA-implemented SoC for HPC. This contains 4 Z-scale processors
with a 2x2 concentrated mesh with 2 virtual channels. The Z-Scale was chosen
for area-efficiency on FPGA.</li>
<li>The network is implemented using the <a href="https://github.com/LBL-CoDEx/OpenSoCFabric">OpenSoC
fabric</a> (open source and in
chisel). AHB endpoints have now beed added and AXI is in-development.</li>
<li>A 96-core system was constructed using multiple FPGAs.</li>

<h2 id="grvi-phalanx-a-massively-parallel-risc-v-fpga-accelerator-jan-gray:404bdd89395af7de00a88d5e9af98f5d">GRVI Phalanx. A massively parallel RISC-V FPGA accelerator: Jan Gray</h2>

<ul>
<li>GRVI is pronounced &lsquo;groovy&rsquo;.</li>
<li>There&rsquo;s lots of interest in FPGA accelerators right now (Altera acquisition,
MSR&rsquo;s catapult).</li>
<li>FPGAs are an interesting platform. Massively parallel. Specialized.<br />
Connected. High throughput. Low latency. The big barrier is of course porting
your software. Jan argues OpenCL for FPGAs is a major breakthrough for this
problem, if you&rsquo;re lucky enough to have an application that can be expressed
in OpenCL.</li>
<li>Phalanx is an accelerator accelerator - an infrastructure making it easier
to run you application on an FPGA and connect everything together. It is
composed of processor+accelerator clusters+NoC.</li>
<li>Jan&rsquo;s Razor: &ldquo;In a CMP, cut inessential resources from each CPU, to maximize
CPUs per die.&rdquo;</li>
<li>Jan has achieved an RV32I datapath in about 250 LUTs. This core can achieve
300-375MHz, 1.3-1.6CPI. The &lsquo;GRVI&rsquo; core is ~320 6-LUTs so &ldquo;1 MIPS/LUT&rdquo;.</li>
